# NASA-24-Hour-Hackathon-Chemosynthesis-Simulation
Built in 24 hours for the NASA Space Apps Hackathon, this project is an interactive simulation of alien oceans where life thrives through chemosynthesis instead of sunlight. Inspired by hydrothermal vents and worlds like Europa, it visualizes ecosystems powered by chemical energy sources such as Hâ‚‚S and methane.
