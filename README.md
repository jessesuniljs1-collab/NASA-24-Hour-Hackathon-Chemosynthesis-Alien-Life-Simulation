🌌 NASA Ocean World Ecosystem Simulator

Built in 24 hours for the NASA Space Apps Hackathon

This project simulates chemosynthetic ecosystems that could exist in subsurface oceans of alien worlds (Europa, Enceladus, and the hypothetical Thalassa Nova). It visualizes how life might thrive without sunlight, relying instead on hydrothermal vent chemistry.

🚀 Features

Interactive Ecosystem Simulation

Adjust initial producers, predators, and hydrothermal activity.

Observe the rise, collapse, or stabilization of alien ecosystems.


Multiple Ocean Worlds

🌍 Europa – 100 km subsurface ocean below ice.

🪐 Enceladus – geyser-driven life potential.

✨ Thalassa Nova – a hypothetical deep-ocean exoplanet.


Realistic Chemistry & Energy Sources

Tracks compounds like H₂S, CH₄, and SO₄²⁻.

Shows key chemosynthetic reactions powering alien ecosystems.


Organism Dynamics

Primary Producers (chemosynthetic bacteria).

Consumers (filter feeders).

Apex Predators (serpentine hunters).


Mission Planning Dashboard

Displays current missions (Europa Clipper, Cassini Legacy, Future Probes).

Shows discovery probabilities (biosignatures, complex life).


Failure & Discovery Events

Ecosystem collapse warnings.

Randomized scientific discoveries when conditions align.



🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend: HTML, CSS (Tailwind), JavaScript (Canvas + Chart.js).

UI: Responsive control panels with live updates.

Visualization: Real-time ecosystem rendering with procedural particle systems.

No backend required — everything runs in-browser!

🌍 Why This Matters

Most ecosystems on Earth depend on sunlight, but in alien oceans sealed under thick ice, life could survive through chemosynthesis. This simulator helps visualize how such ecosystems might evolve, stabilize, or collapse — valuable for astrobiology and future NASA missions.
