🌌 NASA 24-Hour Hackathon – Chemosynthesis Simulation

This project was built in just 24 hours during the NASA Space Apps Hackathon by our team of friends. 🚀✨

We designed an interactive simulation that explores how life could thrive in alien oceans beyond sunlight, using chemosynthesis instead of photosynthesis. Inspired by hydrothermal vents on Earth and potential ecosystems on worlds like Europa and Enceladus, this simulation demonstrates how energy from chemical reactions can sustain life in environments with no sunlight.

🔬 Features

🌊 Aquatic World Simulation – visualize life in deep oceans powered by chemosynthesis

⚡ Chemical Energy Sources – H₂S, methane, and other compounds fueling alien ecosystems

🐚 Interactive Organisms – dynamic ecosystem growth and survival mechanics

📊 Data-Driven Approach – integrates real NASA/space science insights on ocean worlds

🎮 Built for Exploration – simple UI, easy interaction, and educational for all ages

⏱️ Hackathon Challenge

Theme: “Beyond Sunlight: An Aquatic Chemosynthetic World”
Duration: 24 hours
Team: Built collaboratively with friends

🚀 Tech Stack

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Visualization: Canvas / DOM-based simulation

Data: NASA & planetary science references

🌍 Why This Matters

Most ecosystems on Earth depend on sunlight. But on distant ocean worlds covered in ice, chemosynthesis could be the foundation of life. Our project demonstrates how studying Earth’s deep-sea vents can help us model potential alien oceans and expand our understanding of life in the universe.

👉 Perfect for anyone interested in astrobiology, planetary science, and creative coding!
